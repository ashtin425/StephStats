# StephStats
With this project, my goal was to create a list of variables that I can go back and use in order to make calculations and predictions of NBA player Stephen Curry's stats. When I first downloaded the dataset, the 'Date' column datatype was a varchar(255) and was formated differently from a datetime so while in Excel I changed all the the dates to be just their corresponding month in order for easier and cleaner coding while using Jupyter Notebooks. My main goal was to see Steph Curry's 3 point shot percentages and how they look this year compared to years past. So most of the data and variables created are catered to see his stats year by year, and month by month over his career. After plotting the information using simple bar charts in matplotlib, it gave me enough information to do a small write up on Steph Curry's shooting slump at the time and make some early predictions as to the rest of his season will go. The full write up can be seen here https://choetsusports.wordpress.com/.
